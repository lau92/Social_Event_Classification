This code has been desgined to classify images using metadates, it classified in event or non event and if it’s event in what class.

1º DESCRIPTOR: 
Extracts tags from every train images and save each tags in the corresponding event file.   

2º CLASSIFICATOR:
Takes document_id and tags from corresponding event type file. It generate a list with both parameters where the first position is document_id and the second is a list with all tags. 
Then the classificator compare each tag list with one of the descriptor files. 
For every comparation extracts the number of equal tags that exists in every file, with a function the classificator find out what kind of event is.
Those results are saved in a file, in two columns:
-Document_id
-Event type  


3ª EVALUATION:
 
The evaluator takes the classificator results and read the ground truth, comparing the event types and making the confusion matrix. 
With these values the evaluator calculates the precision, recall, F1 score and average of previous (precision, recall, F1 score). 
Show the results in a bar graph and save it in a .txt file.
