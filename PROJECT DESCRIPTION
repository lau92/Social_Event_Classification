PROJECT EXPLANATION
This code has been designed to classify images using metadates.
Classify in event or non event and if itâ€™s event in wich class.

 DESCRIPTOR: 
 Extracts tags from every train image and save each tag in the corresponding event file.   

 CLASSIFICATOR:
 Takes document_id and tags from corresponding event type file.
 It generates a list with both parameters where the first position is document_id and the second is a list with all tags. 
 Then, the classificator compare each tag list with one of the descriptor files. 
 For every comparation extracts the number of equal tags that exists in every file.
 With a function the classificator find out what type of event is.
 Those results are saved in a file in two columns:
  -document_id
  -event_type  

 EVALUATION:
 The evaluator takes the classificator results and read the ground truth.
 Compares the event types and makes the confusion matrix. 
 With these values the evaluator calculates the precision, recall, F1 score and average of previous.
 Show the results in a bar graph and save it in a .txt file.
